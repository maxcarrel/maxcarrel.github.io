This project aims at infering which activity is performed by analysing the output of a smartphone sensors (accelerometer and gyrometer).

The features of the project are:

* R programming
* Data Cleansing
* Classification Tree
* Random Forest
* Hyperparameter Fitting using K-Fold Cross-Validation

## *Upcoming:* Pump It Up

An analysis based on the [Pump It Up DrivenData competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/) aiming at predicting the maintenance requirement and functioning state of Tanzanian waterpoints. This project features:

* Python programming (Pandas and Scikit-learn)
* Jupyter Notbook
* Multi-label classification using Logistic Regression
* Hyperparameter Fitting using K-Fold Cross-Validation
