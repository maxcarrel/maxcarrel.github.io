# Project Portfolio

This page presents a portfolio of projects related to Data Science and Analytics. All of these projects are hosted on [my github account](https://github.com/maxcarrel/).

## [Human Activity Recognition](https://github.com/maxcarrel/Human-Activity-Recognition)

This project aims at infering which activity is performed by analysing the output of a smartphone sensors (accelerometer and gyrometer).

The features of the project are:

* R programming
* Data Cleansing
* Classification Tree
* Random Forest
* Hyperparameter Fitting using K-Fold Cross-Validation

## [Pump It Up: Data Mining the Water Table](https://github.com/maxcarrel/pump-it-up)

An analysis based on the [Pump It Up DrivenData competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/) aiming at predicting the maintenance requirement and functioning state of Tanzanian waterpoints. This project features:

* Python programming (Pandas and Scikit-learn)
* Jupyter Notbook
* Multi-label classification using Logistic Regression
* Hyperparameter Fitting using K-Fold Cross-Validation

## [Weight Lifting Analysis](https://github.com/maxcarrel/weight-lifting-analysis)

This project presents an analysis of weight lifting exercises. It aims at detecting common execution mistakes based on-body sensor data. This project features:

* Python programming
* Apache Spark (DataFrame API) and MLlib
* Machine learning pipelines
* Random Forest with Hyperparameter Fitting

## *Upcoming:* Swiftkey Smart Keybord

This project aims at building a smart keyboard application that will make suggestions to the user as words are being typed. This projects includes:

* Natural Language Processing
* N-grams Modelling
