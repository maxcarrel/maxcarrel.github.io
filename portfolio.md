# Project Portfolio

This page presents a portfolio of projects related to Data Science and Analytics. These projects can also be reached from [my github account](https://github.com/maxcarrel/).

## [Human Activity Recognition](https://github.com/maxcarrel/Human-Activity-Recognition)

This project aims at infering which activity is performed by analysing the output of a smartphone sensors (accelerometer and gyrometer).

The features of the project are:

* R programming
* Data Cleansing
* Classification Tree
* Random Forest
* Hyperparameter Fitting using K-Fold Cross-Validation

## [Pump It Up: Data Mining the Water Table](https://github.com/maxcarrel/pump-it-up)

An analysis based on the [Pump It Up DrivenData competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/) aiming at predicting the maintenance requirement and functioning state of Tanzanian waterpoints. This project features:

* Python programming (Pandas and Scikit-learn)
* Jupyter Notbook
* Multi-label classification using Logistic Regression
* Hyperparameter Fitting using K-Fold Cross-Validation

## *Upcoming:* DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread

The goal of this project is predict the prevalence of the dengue fever in two cities (San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru) based on environmental data collected by various U.S. Federal Agencies (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). This project is based on a [DrivenData competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/) and features:

* Python programming
* Apache Spark (PySpark, DataFrame API)
* Linear Regression
